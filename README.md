Greetings, I'm Jonathan! 👋

About Me
I'm a Senior at the University of Minnesota majoring in Computer Science, Embedded Systems. I'm passionate about Embedded systems and aspire to become a Embedded/firmware Engineer. My experience includes designing and reading schematics, utilizing communication peripherals like SPI, I2C, UART, and BLE, and primarily using bare metal boards.

What I'm Interested In
- 🌩️ Embedded/Firmware Engineering: Creating memory efficient devices that perform tasks which make an impact on people, without the use of an entire Operating System.

Current Projects
- Bluetooth Video game controller: I'm currently building a device that advertises game controller data, and sends it to a python script via BLE, and map that data to keyboard keys.
